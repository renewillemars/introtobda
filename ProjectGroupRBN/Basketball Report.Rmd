## Moneyball in the NBA

For the Big Data project we choose to apply the thinking from the recent book (and movie) Moneyball by Michael Lewis to data collected from the NBA. We set out to answer three questions:

- How many games do teams need to win to reach the playoffs?                                          
- What determines whether teams will win games?                                                       
- Are players fairly compensates based on their relative contribution?
